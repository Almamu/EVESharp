# Preamble
- Almamu: I'd like to thank all the developers of the [EVEmu project](https://github.com/evemuproject/) and all the people that have contributed to it over the years. EVEmu was the very first open source project I contributed to over 10 years ago, I learned a lot about Networking protocols from it. This project was inspired by EVEmu, to put in practice all I learned from it well over 7 years ago, but was kind of forgotten after some commits. Around 2020/01/29 I decided to start working on it again, rewritting most of the stuff to be faster and easier to understand.
