		<description>&lt;b&gt;Intelligence is a measure of a pilot's capacity for learning, reasoning, and understanding.&lt;/b&gt; It is also an aptitude indicator for cognitive abilities such as logical reasoning and abstract thinking. In the EVE universe, pilots with a high intelligence score possess an innate mastery of core academic disciplines such as mathematics and physics.

&lt;b&gt;Skill categories&lt;/b&gt; such as &lt;b&gt;Electronics, Engineering, Navigation, and Science all require direct application of these disciplines&lt;/b&gt; and build extensively on them throughout the pilot's skill advancement, irrespective of career choice. Additionally, advanced starship technologies such as &lt;b&gt;Electronic Warfare, Shield Operation, and Cloaking&lt;/b&gt; will require a high Intelligence score to master quickly.

This attribute is secondary for numerous &lt;b&gt;social and industrial skills&lt;/b&gt; as well.</description>
