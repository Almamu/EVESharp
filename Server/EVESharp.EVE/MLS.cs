EVE is offered by CCP hf (\"CCP\"), a company based in Reykjavik, Iceland dedicated to the creation of next generation Internet games. EVE is a multiplayer role playing game that allows the participation of thousands of players around the world, interacting in the same game environment. You may play EVE using CCP\'s proprietary software (the \"Software\") that allows you to log into CCP\'s computer system (the \"System\") online and interact within the game environment created by CCP. To play, CCP requires that you review and agree to the following terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis End User License Agreement (\"EULA\") describes the terms and conditions under which you may (i) install and use the Software; and (ii) subscribe to, access and use EVE online. CCP may amend this EULA from time to time by posting an amended version at <a href=shellexec:http://www.eve-online.com/pnp/eula.asp>http://www.eve-online.com/pnp/eula.asp</a>. If you accept this EULA, the then-current version of this EULA shall apply each time you access the System or play EVE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n%(transgameInsert)s\r\n\r\nBy clicking the \"ACCEPT\" button below, and confirming your acceptance by clicking the \"CONFIRMED\" button (or if you bypass or otherwise disable the \"ACCEPT\" and/or \"CONFIRMED\" buttons, and still install, copy, download, access or otherwise use the Software or the Game), you accept the terms and conditions in the EULA. If you do not accept the terms and conditions in the EULA, you must click the \"DECLINE\" button, discontinue use of the Software and not access the System or use EVE. If you are the original purchaser of a boxed version of the Software on CD-ROM, you should contact the retailer for a refund. CCP does not manufacture or distribute the box version of the Game and is not responsible for refunding any fees relating thereto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">REQUIREMENTS TO PLAY</span><br>\r\nTo play EVE, you must: (i) purchase a license to the Software (this may be available with the purchase of a boxed version of the Game and/or from the EVE web site http://www.eve-online.com); (ii) establish online a valid account (an \"Account\") and keep that Account active by paying the subscription fees on a timely basis; (iii) obtain and maintain your own Internet access (Internet access is required to play EVE; CCP is not responsible for your access to the Internet); and (iv) comply with the EULA.\r\n</LI>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">YOUR ACCOUNT</span><br>\r\nYou may establish only one (1) account for each copy of the Software licensed. If you wish to establish another Account, you must obtain another license for the Software (you may be able to do this by purchasing another boxed version of the Software or from the EVE Online web site http://www.eve-online.com).\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<b>A.  Establishing a New Account</b>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\r\n\tUpon establishing a new Account, you will be entitled to play EVE for up to thirty (30) days without paying the subscription fee (the \"Trial Period\").  If your Account is not terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth below within that thirty (30) day period, you will be charged the subscription fees as described during the registration process when you established your Account.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\tOnly an individual, natural person who is an adult or, in the discretion of such an adult, his or her minor child, may establish an Account. You are responsible and liable for all activities conducted through your Account, regardless of who conducts those activities.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\tYou may not share your Account with anyone, or allow anyone other than you personally (or your minor child, if you have registered an Account on behalf of your minor child) to access or use your Account. Joint or shared ownership or use of an Account by more than one user is prohibited.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\tAccounts may not be used for business purposes. Access to the System and playing EVE is intended for your personal entertainment, enjoyment and recreation, and not for corporate, business, commercial or income-seeking activities. Business entities and anyone who is acting for or on behalf of a business or for business purposes may not establish an Account, access the System or play EVE. Accessing the System or using the Game for commercial, business or income-seeking purposes is strictly prohibited.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<b>B.  Passwords and Names</b>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tYou will be asked to select a password during the registration process (\"Password\"). You may not disclose your Password to anyone or allow anyone to use your Password to access the System or play EVE. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Password and for any damage, harm, lost or deleted characters, etc. resulting from your disclosure, or allowing the disclosure, of any Password, or from use by any person of your Password. You may not obtain, attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the password of anyone else. You are responsible for remembering your Account information and Password.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\tYou will be assigned a login name and a character name during the registration and character creation process. You may not allow anyone to use your login name or character name to access the System or play EVE. No player may use the character name of another player to impersonate or falsely represent his or her identity. You may not obtain, attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the login name or character name of anyone else.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\tYou are encouraged to use a pseudonym, but you may not choose a name that violates anyone\'s trademarks, publicity rights or other rights. Acceptance of a pseudonym by the System does not mean that your chosen pseudonym does not violate anyone\'s rights. You are responsible for any liability incurred by yourself, CCP or anyone else due to the pseudonym you choose. CCP retains the right to reject any pseudonym it determines, in its sole discretion, is unlawful, indecent, obscene or otherwise violates standards of good taste.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<b>C.  Children</b>\r\n\t<i>i.  Responsibility for Account</i>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tMinor children may not establish an Account without the consent of a parent or guardian. If the user of EVE is a minor, a parent or guardian must complete the registration process to establish an Account, in which case the parent or guardian takes full responsibility for all obligations under the EULA and for all activities of the child using the Account. If you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one child to use the Account instead of you (in which case you may not use that Account).\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\tIf you establish an Account, you represent that you are an adult thirteen (13) years of age or older and are either accepting the EULA on behalf of yourself or on behalf of your child, in which latter case you agree to the EULA with regard to your child and represent that you are also personally bound by the EULA.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t<i>ii.  Game Rating</i>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tEVE has a \"TEEN\" rating. Parents may find it inappropriate for use by children under the age of thirteen (13).\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tCCP has established Rules of Conduct (discussed below) for players accessing the System and may, but is not obligated to, monitor and take action regarding inappropriate conduct. Nonetheless, it is possible that at any time there may be language or other material accessible on or through the System that you may consider inappropriate for children or that may be offensive to some users of any age. You acknowledge that other players may transmit communications or content, or access to content, that you may consider inappropriate or objectionable. CCP does not, as a matter of policy, prescreen the communications or content transmitted by each player and is in no way responsible for the communications and content transmitted by players of the Game.\r\n\t<br><br>\r\n\tCCP does not knowingly collect any information about children under the age of thirteen (13) beyond that necessary to establish an Account and play the Game. CCP will not disclose such information to any third party except as set forth below.\r\n\t<br>\r\n</LI>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">ACCOUNT TRANSFER / CHARACTER TRANSFER</span><br>\r\nYou are not permitted to transfer your account to another person. If you wish to discontinue your account please refer to section 6. of this EULA. You may transfer a character from your account to another account, either belonging to you or another person. This transfer option is available from the EVE Online Account Management web site https://secure.eve-online.com/login.asp and is subject to fees and the following limitations:\r\n\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>You may not offer to transfer characters except your own, or act as a \"broker\" or intermediary (for compensation or otherwise) for anyone wishing to transfer or obtain characters.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>The transferee will obtain all rights to your character in a single transaction, and you will retain absolutely no control or rights over the characters, items or attributes of that character.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>You may not transfer any characters whose attributes are, in whole or in part, developed, or which own items, objects or currency obtained or acquired, in violation of the EULA.</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nAny character transfers or attempted transfers not in accordance with the foregoing terms is prohibited and void, and  shall not be binding on CCP. A transfer or attempted transfer of a character is entirely at the risk of the parties to such transaction. CCP is not liable to any person (whether transferor, transferee or otherwise) for any acts, omissions, statements, representations, defaults or liabilities of the parties in connection with such a transaction.\r\n</LI>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS</span><br>\r\nAfter the Trial Period, you are required to pay a subscription fee to maintain your Account, access the System and play EVE. You are informed of the subscription fee and payment terms during the registration process. The current subscription fee and payment terms may be viewed at <a href=shellexec:http://www.eve-online.com/pnp/pricing.asp>http://www.eve-online.com/pnp/pricing.asp</a>, and are incorporated in the EULA by reference. CCP may amend the subscription fee and payment terms at any time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAll subscription fees are in U.S. Dollars or Euros and are non-refundable unless expressly stated otherwise in the EULA. When you establish your Account, you authorize CCP to automatically charge your credit card the subscription fees in accordance with the payment terms (as may be amended by CCP from time to time), plus any applicable taxes that CCP is required to collect. If CCP is unable to process your credit card at any time, your Account may be immediately suspended or terminated at CCP\'s discretion.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou are responsible for reviewing CCP\'s website for changes in the subscription fee or payment terms. If a change is unacceptable to you, you may, as your sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the EULA and close your Account as described in the termination section below. You are responsible for paying all applicable taxes (including those CCP is not required to collect) and for all hardware, software, Internet service and other costs you incur to access the System.\r\n</LI>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">AMENDMENTS TO EULA</span><br>\r\nCCP may, in its sole discretion, amend the EULA from time to time. If the EULA is amended, you will be asked to review the amended EULA when you log into your Account, and to indicate and confirm your acceptance of the amended EULA by clicking the \"ACCEPT\" and/or \"CONFIRMED\" buttons.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf the amendment alters a material term of the EULA that is unacceptable to you, you may, as your sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the EULA and close your Account as described in the termination section below.\r\n</LI>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">TERMINATION; SUSPENSION OF ACCOUNT</span><br>\r\n<b>A.  By CCP for Termination of the Game</b>\r\n<br>\r\nCCP does not guarantee that it will continue to offer access to the System or support the Game. CCP may, in its sole discretion, cease to provide any or all of the services offered in connection with EVE (including access to the System and any or all features or components of the Game), terminate the EULA, close all Accounts and cancel all of the rights granted to you under the EULA. CCP may communicate such termination to you upon 30 days notice in any of the following manners: (i) when you log into your Account; (ii) in a notice on CCP\'s website; (iii) via electronic mail; or (iv) in another manner that CCP deems suitable to inform you of the termination. If CCP terminates the EULA pursuant to this section, you will not receive a refund of prepaid subscription fees.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>B.  By CCP for Breach or Misconduct</b>\r\n<i>i.  Suspension of Account</i><br>\r\nWithout limiting CCP\'s rights or remedies, CCP may immediately, and without notice, discontinue or suspend access to the System through your Account, and any and all other Accounts that share the name, phone number, e-mail address, internet protocol address or credit card number with the discontinued or suspended Account, in the event of (i) a breach of the EULA (including the Rules of Conduct) by you or any user under your Account; or (ii) unauthorized access to the System or use of the Game by you or any user under your Account.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<i>ii.  Termination of EULA</i><br>\r\nCCP may terminate the EULA, close all your Accounts, and cancel all rights granted to you under the EULA if: (i) you fail to pay the subscription fee when due; (ii) CCP is unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide; (iii) you or anyone using any of your Accounts materially breaches the EULA, makes any unauthorized use of the System or Software, or infringes the rights of CCP or any third party; or (iv) CCP becomes aware of game play, chat or player activity under your Account that is, in CCP\'s discretion, inappropriate or in violation of the Rules of Conduct. Such termination shall be effective upon notice transmitted via electronic mail, or any other means reasonably calculated to reach you. CCP reserves the right to terminate any and all other Accounts that share the name, phone number, e-mail address, internet protocol address or credit card number with the closed Account. Termination by CCP under this section shall be without prejudice to or waiver of any and all of CCP\'s other rights or remedies, all of which are expressly reserved, survive termination, and are cumulative. You will not receive a refund of prepaid subscription fees for a termination pursuant to this section.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>C.  By You</b><br>\r\n<i>i.  Anytime</i><br>\r\nYou may terminate the EULA with regard to any or all of your Accounts at any time, upon notice to CCP via electronic mail. You will not receive a refund of prepaid subscription fees in the event of such termination.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<i>ii.  For a Change in the Subscription Fee or Payment Terms</i>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a change in the subscription fee or payment terms is unacceptable to you, you may, as your sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the EULA and close all of your Accounts by notifying CCP via electronic mail within thirty (30) days after the later of (a) the date that CCP has posted the change on its website; or (b) the date the change has impacted your Account (e.g., your credit card has been charged).

Specifically Restricted Conduct</b>\r\n<br>\r\nYour continued access to the System and license to play the Game is subject to proper conduct. Without limiting CCP\'s rights to control the Game environment, and the conduct of the players within that environment, CCP prohibits the following practices that CCP has determined detract from the overall user experience of the users playing the Game:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>You may not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the System.</li>\r\n\t<li>You may not use your own or third-party software to modify any content appearing within the Game environment or change how the Game is played.</li>\r\n\t<li>You may not use macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items, currency, objects, character attributes, rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary Game play. You may not rewrite or modify the user interface or otherwise manipulate data in any way to acquire items, currency, objects, character attributes or beneficial actions not actually acquired or achieved in the Game.</li>\r\n\t<li>You may not use the Software, or any information accessible through the System, to bypass the System login architecture or create or provide any other means through which the System may be accessed and/or the Game may be played by others, as, for example, through server emulators.</li>\r\n\t<li>You may not engage in any conduct that results in an Account containing items, objects, currency, character attributes, rank, or status that are inappropriate for the level or rank of the character contained in the Account, including without limitation arranging, making or accepting transfers of items to a character without adequate consideration, thereby augmenting or aggregating items in an Account and increasing its value for an Account sale.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<b>B.  Selling Items and Objects</b>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may not transfer, sell or auction, or buy or accept any offer to transfer, sell or auction (or offer to do any of the foregoing), any content appearing within the Game environment, including without limitation characters, character attributes, items, currency, and objects, other than via a permitted Character Transfer as described in section 3 above. You may not encourage or induce any other person to participate in such a prohibited transaction. The buying, selling or auctioning (or any attempt at doing so) of characters, character attributes, items, currency, or objects, whether through online auctions (such as ebay), newsgroups, postings on message boards or any other means is prohibited by the EULA and a violation of CCP\'s proprietary rights in the Game.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>C.  Compliance with Rules of Conduct</b>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree to observe and abide by the Rules of Conduct as may be amended by CCP from time to time. The current version of the Rules of Conduct may be viewed at <a href=shellexec:http://www.eve-online.com/pnp/terms.asp>http://www.eve-online.com/pnp/terms.asp</a>, and are incorporated in the EULA by reference.\r\n</LI>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</span><br>\r\n<b>A.

You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy regarding communications you make in the Game, whether through private in-Game messaging, during chat, or in chat rooms. CCP representatives may monitor communications made by or received from you. You should not provide private information to any other player in the Game. CCP shall not be responsible for the consequences of any such disclosure by you.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nYou may encounter and converse with people who are rude, offensive, belligerent, and who may use indecent, obscene, and/or threatening or harassing language while playing the Game. You may report any instances of such behavior to CCP. CCP will investigate and take such measures as CCP, in its sole judgment, determines are reasonable under the circumstances. CCP does not guarantee that you will not encounter behavior of others that you may view as insulting, demeaning, offensive, threatening or harassing. You assume all risk associated with playing the Game, and CCP assumes no responsibility for the conduct of any other players, and shall not be liable to you or any other person for their conduct.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>B.  Personal Information</b>\r\n<br>\r\nCCP does not guarantee that personal information transmitted to the System, including without limitation information in your Account, will not be disclosed to third parties. While CCP\'s aim is to keep your personal information confidential and CCP employs security measures to protect the System, third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions or private communications, or access data within the System. Additionally, CCP may (and you hereby expressly authorize CCP to) disclose information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials, as CCP, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible crimes or to respond to judicial, regulatory, agency or similar inquiries.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCCP may monitor usage of the System to gather statistical information that it may disclose to third parties. CCP may also contact you using the information you provided to, for example, provide technical support, respond to user inquiries, transmit questionnaires and offer products and services. You may also verify and update your Account information by logging into your Account through the account management page at <a href=shellexec:https://secure.eve-online.com/login.asp>https://secure.eve-online.com/login.asp</a>.\r\n</LI>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">SEIZURE WARNING</span><br>\r\nIn rare instances, some users may experience seizures when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain light patterns or backgrounds on a video monitor may induce an epileptic seizure, even in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy.\r\n</LI>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<LI><span style=\"font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:2px\">LICENSE</span><br>\r\n\r\n<b>A.

If the Software and/or the System contains license management technology, you may not circumvent or disable that technology.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>D.  Software Updates</b>\r\n<br>\r\nCCP may from time to time update or otherwise modify the Software electronically. You hereby grant CCP permission to: (i) extract hardware system profile data from your computer; (ii) extract information from your computer\'s file directories pertaining to the Game and your ability to access the System; (iii) download to your computer content and Game files and any data related to the operation of the Game. The foregoing applies to any computer from which you log into the System using your Account.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>E.  New Releases of the Software</b>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not entitled to receive any new releases of the Software, or any expansion packs, updates, upgrades or similar products under the EULA, but CCP may, in its sole discretion, offer any or all of the foregoing to you. CCP may update, upgrade or otherwise enhance the Software at any time, in its sole discretion, without obligation to you. Periodically, CCP will require all users to migrate to new releases of the Software in order to continue accessing the System and playing EVE. You will be informed when a new release is available and will have a period of time in which to procure and install the new release. You must install and use the new release before the period of time has lapsed to continue accessing the System and playing EVE.

It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Preamble</b>\r\n<br>\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n<br>\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\r\n<br>\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n<br>\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\r\n<br>\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\'s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. \r\n<br>\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n<br>\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\r\n<br>\r\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user\'s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n<br>\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users\' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n<br>\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. \r\n<br>\r\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n<br>\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n<br>\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n<br>\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\r\n<br>\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n<br>\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\'s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n<br>\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n<br>\r\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n<br>\r\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n<br>\r\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n<br>\r\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n<br>\r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n<br>\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n<br>\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n<br>\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. \r\n<br>\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n<br>\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n<br>\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n<br>\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n<br>\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n<br>\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \r\n<br>\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\'s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n<br>\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n<br>\r\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\r\n<br>\r\nb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user\'s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n<br>\r\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n<br>\r\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\r\n<br>\r\ne) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n<br>\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n<br>\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. \r\n<br>\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n<br>\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\n<br>\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n<br>\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n<br>\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\r\n<br>\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. \r\n<br>\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n<br>\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n<br>\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n<br>\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n<br>\r\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n<br>\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n<br>\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \r\n<br>\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n<br>\r\n";

You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;one line to give the library\'s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright \xa9 &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary.

If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-3.2\">3.2</a>, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n<br>\r\n<h4 style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Times\"><b>(b) Contributor APIs</b></h4>\r\nIf Contributor\'s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the <b>LEGAL</b> file.\r\n<br>\r\n<h4 style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Times\"><b>(c) Representations.</b></h4>\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-3.4-a\">a</a>) above, Contributor believes that Contributor\'s Modifications are Contributor\'s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3><b>3.5. Required Notices.</b></h3>\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#exhibit-a\">Exhibit A</a> in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#exhibit-a\">Exhibit A</a>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients\' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3><b>3.6.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients\' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient\'s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3><b>3.7. Larger Works.</b></h3>\r\n\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n<br>\r\n<h2><b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b></h2>\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the <b>LEGAL</b> file described in Section <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-3.4\">3.4</a> and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n<br>\r\n<h2><b>5. Application of this License.</b></h2>\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#exhibit-a\">Exhibit A</a> and to related Covered Code.\r\n<br>\r\n<h2><b>6. Versions of the License.</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>6.1. New Versions</b></h3>\r\nNetscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time.

Effect of New Versions</b></h3>\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3><b>6.3. Derivative Works</b></h3>\r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\", \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.

If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n<br>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>such Participant\'s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-2.1\">2.1</a> and/or <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-2.2\">2.2</a> of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-2.1\">2.1</a> and/or <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-2.2\">2.2</a> automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.</li>\r\n\r\n  <li>any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant\'s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-2.1-b\">b</a>) and 2.2(<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-2.2-b\">b</a>) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant\'s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-2.1\">2.1</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-2.2\">2.2</a> shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n<br>\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-8.1\">8.1</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html#section-8.2\">8.2</a> above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n<br>\r\n<h2><b>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></h2>\r\n<b>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY\'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.

With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n<br>\r\n<h2><b>12. Responsibility for claims</b></h2>\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n<br>\r\n<h2><b>13.

All militia members share a factional chat channel and read-only mailing list.</li>\r\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 7px\"><b>Ranks</b> - political clout awarded to privateers that prove themselves for the militia! Talented pilots dedicated to the cause can rise through the newly-created ranks, 10 for each faction, by increasing their standing with their chosen militia\'s corporation.</li>\r\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 7px\"><b>Over 320 new Factional Warfare Agents</b> - specifically tasked with coordinating the activities of freelance pod pilots and assigning them missions inside territory held by enemy militias.</li>\r\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 7px\"><b>Statistics</b> - Pilots can track their own warfare victories and kill statistics, as well as those of their corporation and faction. Each pilot\'s map has also been upgraded to better accommodate the increased flow of logistics data. The galactic map can now be configured to show occupancy status of a system, as well as detecting the presence of hostile navy forces.</li>\r\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 7px\"><b>System Occupancy</b> - A new level of system control beyond sovereignty arises - occupancy. Factions gain occupancy of a system by winning conflicts in contested complexes. Accumulate enough victories for your faction and authorization is given to assault the star\'s System Control Bunker within 24 hours. Should the bunker fall to the attacking militia, a cease-fire is called in the system\'s Factional Warfare Complexes, and that faction gains occupancy of the solar system.</li>\r\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 7px\"><b>Combat Zones</b> - Many of these contested regions are located in low-security space, but not all. Systems within a Combat Zone contains a System Control Bunker which coordinates all activity within their system\'s Factional Warfare Complexes.</li>\r\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 7px\"><b>Factional Warfare Complexes</b> - A myriad of hidden deadspace complexes have taken on great strategic importance. Militia pilots that successfully scan for a complex and hold it uncontested for a set amount of time will claim it for their faction, and be rewarded with corporate standing - as well as more tangible benefits.</li>           \r\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 7px\"><b>World Shaping</b> - The war has pushed forth into new regions of space! \"Black Rise\" contains 49 new star systems and nearly 40 stations, many of which are already sworn to one faction or another.</li>           \r\n</ul>";

The seller and buyer can negotiate the trade ingame, on the forums or anywhere else. The seller then logs into his account management pages, selects a character, enters the time code, enters the amount in ISK and finally makes an offer to the buyer. The web service checks if the code is valid and then the buyer will receive and evemail with details of the offer. The buyer then has 48 hours to consider the offer and complete the transaction. The buyer has to log into his/hers account management pages to complete the transaction, at which time the ISK will be automatically transferred to the seller and the time will be automatically added to the buyers account.\r\n<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>What if the code I get has already been used?</strong><br />\r\nThe seller is not able to sell codes that have already been used or are being offered for sale to someone else.

		public const string SECURELY_SELL_EVE_TIME_CODE_FAQ = "<p><strong>Securely Sell EVE Time Code F.A.Q.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>How does the Secure Time Code Exchange work?</strong><br />\r\nThe Secure Time Code Exchange is a web service to ensure that players can trade Time Codes for ISK without the risk of not receiving their payment, or getting a code that has already been used. The seller and buyer can negotiate the trade ingame, on the forums or anywhere else. The seller then logs into his account management pages, selects a character, enters the time code, enters the amount in ISK and finally makes an offer to the buyer. The web service checks if the code is valid and then the buyer will receive and evemail with details of the offer. The buyer then has 48 hours to consider the offer and complete the transaction. The buyer has to log into his/hers account management pages to complete the transaction, at which time the ISK will be automatically transferred to the seller and the time will be automatically added to the buyers account.\r\n<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>How is this a safe way to sell Time Codes?</strong><br />\r\nThis is a safe way to trade Time Codes both for the seller and the buyer. As a seller you are guaranteed that you get your ISK, and the buyer can not use the code until he/she has paid you. As a buyer you are guaranteed to receive a valid code for your ISK.\r\n<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>What if the code I want to sell has already been used?</strong><br />\r\nYou cannot sell codes that have already been used. The system will check if the code has been used or is already being offered for sale.\r\n<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>How long is my offer active?</strong><br />\r\nYour offer to sell the time code will be active for 48 hours. If the buyer does not complete the transaction within that time the offer will be canceled and the code will remain in your possession. At that point you can offer it to someone else.\r\n<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>What if the buyer doesn\'t have enough ISK?</strong><br />\r\nIf the buyer does not have enough ISK on his character he/she will not be able to complete the transaction. The buyer can still try to raise the ISK while the offer is still valid.\r\n<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>How will I know that the transaction has gone through?</strong><br />\r\nAs soon as the transaction goes through you will receive the ISK into your wallet.<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do I do if I don\'t get the ISK?</strong><br />\r\nFile a petition. The EVE Game Masters will investigate your case as soon as possible, and if they confirm that you traded a code, you may be reimbursed.\r\n<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>What if I trade a code through e-mail, or other sources, and don\'t get my ISK? </strong><br />\r\nThe Secure Time Code Exchange is the only supported method of trading EVE Time Codes for ISK. Any other methods of trading Time Codes are not allowed. The EVE Customer Support will not support such trade and action may be taken against accounts who trade in timecodes outside our system.\r\n<br />\xa0\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"secselletc.aspx\"><< Back</a></p>\r\n";

		public const string SWAP_CHARACTER_PORTRAIT_FAQ = "<p><strong>1. Swapping portraits, what is that good for? </strong><br />\r\n  For players that are not happy with their original portrait creation. They can \r\n  now create a new character, matching their main character in bloodline and gender \r\n  and make a portrait for that character they are happy with. Once the new character \r\n  is created they can use this option to swap the portraits of their new and main \r\n  character, thus changing the portrait of their main character to something that \r\n  they are happier with. </p>\r\n<p><strong>2 Why do I need to pay for swapping the portraits of my characters?</strong><br />\r\n  Your character portrait is a big part of your identity in EVE the change of \r\n  any part of that identity needs to be limited. CCP understands that late on \r\n  in the game you might start to regret the original choices you made with regards \r\n  to your character portrait. This is why the portrait swapping is supported and \r\n  the surest way of preventing identity hopping is to have real monetary transactions \r\n  behind each portrait swap. </p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Why does gender and bloodline have to match when swapping portraits?</strong><br />\r\n  As bloodline and gender define a lot about your character the portraits that \r\n  are going to be swapped need to have same bloodline and gender. The swapping \r\n  is only meant to fix elements you are not happy about with your original portrait \r\n  creation, it is not meant for gender and ancestry changes. </p>\r\n<p><strong>4. I just swapped the portraits of two of my character but I don\u2019t see the change in-game or on the forums.</strong><br /> As the portrait of your character is cached in various places, it can take up to 24 hours for all caches to be updated with your new portrait settings. Please note that you might also have to delete the \"Portrait\" folder in your cache directory to see the new portrait.<br /><br /> \r\n\r\nThe portraits are cached in the folder <br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>If you are on Windows 2000/XP:</strong><br /><br />\r\n\r\n\"C:\\Documents and Settings\\%username%\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\CCP\\EVE\\c_program_files_ccp_eve_tranquility\\cache\\Pictures\\Portraits\"<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<strong>If you are on Windows Vista assuming EVE is installed at C:\\Program Files\\CCP\\EVE:</strong><br /><br />\r\n\r\n\"C:\\Users\\%user%\\AppData\\Local\\CCP\\EVE\\c_program_files_ccp_eve_tranquility\\cache\\Pictures\\Portraits\". <br /><br />\r\n\r\nSimply copy and paste the paths into the explorers address bar or into the field you get by Start-Run (or Windows-Key + R).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Macintosh:</strong><br/><br />\r\n/Users/username/Library/Preferences/Eve Online Preferences/p_drive/Local Settings/Application Data/CCP/EVE/c_program_files_ccp_eve_tranquility/cache/Pictures/Portraits\r\n<br />\r\n</p>";

		public const string TRANSFER_CHARACTER_FAQ = "\t<strong>1. Why do I have to pay for transferring my character?</strong><br>\r\n\tAs your character is your identity in EVE the transfer of such an identity needs\r\n\tto be limited. Identity hopping and alternate character abuse are immersion breakers\r\n\tin any virtual world; this is why CCP has chosen to limit this as much as possible.\r\n\tIt is clear that some players wish to donate their characters to their friends so\r\n\twe want to keep this possibility open. The surest way to prevent abuse of this feature\r\n\tis to have credit card records backing the transfer. All abuse/hacking/exploitation\r\n\tof this feature will be treated as credit card fraud.\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>2. I have suspended my account and I can't transfer a character from that account,\r\n\t\t\twhy is that?<br>\r\n\t\t</strong>To prevent possible exploit your account needs to be in active state, i.e.\r\n\t\tsubscription is paid for. This is to prevent assets on frozen, banned or otherwise\r\n\t\tsuspended accounts from being transferred.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>3. Why does my character have to be in an NPC corporation to be transferred?<br>\r\n\t\t</strong>Being in a player corporation is a serious commitment. There is no way\r\n\t\tfor CCP to verify that you are transferring your character with the consent of your\r\n\t\tfellow corporation members. To transfer such a character you need to first resign\r\n\t\tfrom your corporation, after the transfer the character can reapply for the corporation\r\n\t\tand the corpmates then have the option of evaluating if they choose to reaccept\r\n\t\tthe character under the changed circumstances.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>4. Why does my character have to be 14 days old or more to be transferred?<br>\r\n\t\t</strong>Transferring a character that is less than 14 days old makes little sense.\r\n\t\tThis limitation is put in place mainly to prevent accidental transfers of wrong\r\n\t\tcharacters.\r\n\t</p>";
