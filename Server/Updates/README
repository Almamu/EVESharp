- Almamu: I want to thank to EVEmu Development Team for those valuable SQL files that will aid in the development of EVESharp.

ORIGINAL FILE WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS:

DATABASE INSTALLATION GUIDE:
=============================
 1. Download official EVE database dump:
     http://eve.no-ip.de/apo15/apo15-mysql5-v1.sql.bz2
    Unpack it - you should get file with ".sql" extension.

 2. Go to subdirectory utils and:
    a) If you are on Windows:
        Execute Merge-Server.bat and Merge-Oficial.bat.
    b) If you are on Linux:
        Execute Merge-Server.sh and Merge-Oficial.sh.

    After that browse back to parent directory sql. Note the 2 new files
    called Oficial.sql and Server.sql.

 3. Create database into which you want to stick all the EVESharp DB stuff.

 4. Import the .sql files in following order:
    a) apo15-mysql5-v1.sql (official dump; the one you downloaded and unpacked)
    b) Oficial.sql
    c) Static.sql
    d) Dynamic.sql
    e) Server.sql
    f) Prime.sql

FILE DESCRIPTION:
===================
Static.sql
**********************
This file contains static data required by EVESharp.

Dynamic.sql
***********************
This file contains dynamic database schema required by EVESharp.

Prime.sql
*************
This is special SQL batch, which is intended to reset all the dynamic stuff into default state.
