# Introduction
EVESharp is an EVE Online Server Emulator written in C#.
It is cluster-based and compatible with the EVE Online Apocrypha 6.14.101.786 client.

# Disclaimer

***EVESharp (or EVE#) is an educational project.***
 This means, our primary interest is to learn and teach us
and our users more about C# project development in a large
scale with clustering support. Our software is not intended
for running public servers, and we do not support that.
We are not responsible for what others do with the source code
downloaded from this project.
