# Introduction
EVESharp (or EVE#) is an EVE Online Server Emulator written in C# for .NET Framework 5.0. This project started off as a rewrite of [EVEmu](https://github.com/evemuproject/evemu_apocrypha/).

The aim is to provide a cluster-based server compatible with EVE Online Aprocrypha 6.14.101786.

**EVESharp (or EVE#) is an educational project**. Our main objective is to learn more about C#, Network-based Applications and Protocols for large scale projects. This software is in no way intended for running public game servers whatsoever, and we do not support that in any way.

**The EVESharp team isn't responsible for the usage given to this software, it is provided AS IS without any kind of warranty, for more information please read [the license](LICENSE)**
